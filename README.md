# Define Problem Statement and Objectives

## Problem statement

The online news platform E-news Express wants to grow its business by attracting more subscribers. To achieve this, the company plans to analyze data from users who visit the landing page to better understand user preferences and behavior. The company’s executives believe that the decline in monthly subscribers from the previous year is due to the website's design, which lacks an engaging layout and relevant content recommendations. Improving these features would potentially encourage users to stay longer and ultimately subscribe.

## Objective

The company’s design team has developed a new landing page with a more refined layout and more relevant content compared to the old version. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new landing page in attracting new subscribers, the Data Science team conducted an experiment. They randomly selected 100 users and split them into two equal groups: The first group (control group) saw the existing landing page, while the second group (treatment group) was shown the new version. The Data Science team measured the time spent on the landing page and whether the user ended up subscribing (converting). As a data scientist at E-news Express, we need to analyze the data and perform statistical analyses at a 5% significance level to assess whether the new landing page is more effective in attracting new subscribers.

The company wants answers to the following questions:

1. Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?

2. Is the conversion rate for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?

3. Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?

4. Is the time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?
